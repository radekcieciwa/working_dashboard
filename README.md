# working_dashboard
Working copies dashboard for better organisation, connected with jira.

## To make most of the tool, add alias to shell, e.g.: .bash_profile

_user_ - Jira user

_password_ - Jira password
```
alias dashboard="./working_dashboard/dashboard.sh [user] [pass] | column -t -s'|'"
```
